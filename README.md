# Paste

A macOS menu bar app that types your saved text when you press a key combination, in any app. Everything is stored in one local file and the app never uses the network. See `CONTEXT.md` for the vocabulary (Binding, Combo, Text, Pause) and `.scratch/paste/spec.md` for the spec.

## Get started

Needs macOS 26 and the Swift toolchain (Command Line Tools are enough).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matthewpeters-extended/paste.git && cd paste
./setup-signing.sh               # once: a local signing certificate, so the Accessibility permission survives rebuilds
./build-app.sh                   # builds build/Paste.app
cp -R build/Paste.app /Applications/
open /Applications/Paste.app
```

macOS may ask whether `codesign` can use the signing key. Choose **Always Allow**.

On first launch a **Welcome** window opens and walks you through setup:

1. **Allow Accessibility.** This is the only permission Paste needs.
2. **Choose whether Paste starts at login.**
3. **Add your first Binding** from the menu bar icon.

## Permissions

| Permission | Needed? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility) | Yes | Lets Paste notice your key combinations in other apps and type the text for you. |
| Login item | Optional | Only if you choose to launch at login. macOS may show a one-time "Paste can run in the background" notice. |
| Input Monitoring, Screen Recording, Network | No | Paste doesn't use them. It never connects to the internet and never touches your clipboard. |

If you rebuild without the signing certificate, macOS may treat each build as a new app. If the Accessibility notice stays after you allowed Paste, remove Paste from the list with **−**, reopen the app and allow it again. Paste doesn't type into password fields.

## Test

```sh
./test.sh
```

`./test.sh` wraps `swift test` with the flags the Command Line Tools need to find Swift Testing. Tests cover `PasteCore`, which has no macOS code. The menu bar, key recorder, typing and permission screens are checked by hand.

## Layout

- `Sources/PasteCore`: Bindings, Pause, duplicate and system-Combo checks, storage.
- `Sources/Paste`: the app (popover, Settings window, key listener, typer).

Bindings are saved in `~/Library/Application Support/Paste/bindings.json`.
